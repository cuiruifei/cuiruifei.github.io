I am a third-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Tom Heskes](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~tomh/) in [Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)](https://www.ru.nl/icis/), Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands. 

My doctoral topic is about causal inference, in which I focus on structure learning from mixed continuous and discrete data (possibly with missing values). Main tools in my research are latent variable models (specifically copula models and factor models), Bayesian inference techniques, and methods for causal discovery. Recently, I have also become interested in (deep) generative models, Bayesian nonparametrics and Regularized Bayesian Inference.
